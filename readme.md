### Description
An exercise to minimise unnecessary code in css and html using refactoring code Techniques. The key take away from this exercise is to schedule time for refactoring and to endeavor to keep code clean as well as comment what each part of your code is doing to save time for other developers.  
### How to Install
Download the files from the download button, find where the fileset has been downloaded to and place them into their own file named refactor.  Double check that the css and html pathfiling is correct.  Look for the following attribute <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css" media="screen" /> and ensure the href="styles.css".  As well as the other assets in the page are linked to correctly otherwise the page will be unformatted and horrendous.
